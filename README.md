# Computation Graphic Algorithm Library - Python

This code involves using the Shapely library to create a closed polygon with randomly generated vertices and Matplotlib to visualize the polygon. The key functionalities include:
* Generating a closed polygon with a specified number of random vertices.
* Plotting lines from a random point within the polygon to each of its vertices.
* Identifying and visualizing non-intersecting lines from the internal point to the polygon vertices.
* Visualizing the polygon, lines from the vertex, and non-intersecting lines using Matplotlib.
The code objective is to find the vertices visible to the internal point by using geometric algorithms, visualizing it in plots, and the integration of different Python libraries to perform complex spatial analysis.
